### Guide for 'How to get BLE to transfer data to laptop using Linux OS and Bluepy library'?

##Step 1 - Downloading Oracle VirtualBox + Ubuntu (10GB+) [IF YOU ARE DUAL-BOOTING, SKIP STEPS 1-2]
https://itsfoss.com/install-linux-in-virtualbox/

Follow steps outlined in article, recommended to download Ubuntu ver 18.04 or later.

If err: AMD-V is disabled in the BIOS,
then activate it in your BIOS settings first. (Shutdown + F9/10/11/12 key depending on system)

##Step 2 - Guest Additions (not needed but recommended for smoother transfer of files)

After following above steps to install guest additions, then just few extra steps to enable folder sharing..

Follow the guide listed below for Ubuntu 18.04+

(Might have some technical issues along the way..)


Note 1: Make sure your Network Adapter is using "NAT" instead of "Bridged" for connections to NUS-Wifi if needed.
Note 2: Need to manually enable Bluetooth everytime Ubuntu is booted from the VirtualBox, goto drop-down menu
        "Devices -> USB -> (YOUR_BLUETOOTH_DEVICE_HERE)"
        //If not displaying your laptop's bt device/driver, wait awhile or might even need to restart your laptop.

##Step 3 - Setting up the environment for running Bluepy

1. Make sure python is installed, either 2 or 3. (So far only tested on python 2)

2.
For python3:
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3-pip
    
When the installation is complete, verify the installation by checking the pip version:
    pip3 --version
    
For python2:
    sudo add-apt-repository universe
    sudo apt update 
    sudo apt install python2
    
    //Might need install curl if not previously installed, sudo apt install curl
    curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py --output get-pip.py
    sudo python2 get-pip.py

Verify the installation by printing the pip version number:
    pip2 --version
    
3.  sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev
Python2:
    sudo pip2 install bluepy
Python3:    
    sudo pip3 install bluepy
    
###
Now all the necessary libraries should be installed, py program ready to be run on laptop!

Go to the respective directory and run python2 bleServer.py or python3 bleServer.py
