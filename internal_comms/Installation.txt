### Guide for 'How to get BLE to transfer data to laptop using Linux OS and Bluepy library'?

# Step 1 - Downloading Oracle VirtualBox + Ubuntu (10GB+) [IF YOU ARE DUAL-BOOTING, SKIP STEPS 1-2]
Ref: https://itsfoss.com/install-linux-in-virtualbox/
//Follow steps outlined in article, recommended to download Ubuntu ver 18.04 or later.

*If err: AMD-V is disabled in the BIOS,
*then activate it in your BIOS settings first. (Shutdown + F9/10/11/12 key depending on system)

# Step 2 - Guest Additions (NEEDED for transfer of files AND BLUETOOTH!!!)
a) Installing Guest Additions
Ref: https://itsfoss.com/virtualbox-guest-additions-ubuntu/

b) Making shared folder between main host(your Windows) and guest host(your VM/Ubuntu)
Ref: https://gist.github.com/estorgio/0c76e29c0439e683caca694f338d4003 (18.04+)

'''
Note 1: Make sure your Network Adapter is using "Bridged" for port forwarding.
Note 2: Need to manually enable Bluetooth everytime Ubuntu is booted from the VirtualBox, goto drop-down menu
        "Devices -> USB -> (YOUR_BLUETOOTH_DEVICE_HERE)"
*If not displaying your laptop's Bluetooth device/driver, your laptop's Bluetooth driver MIGHT NOT BE COMPATIBLE with VMBox.
*May need to buy Bluetooth dongle... (GBU851)

# Step 3 - Setting up the environment for running Bluepy (On your VMBox)
Ref: https://github.com/IanHarvey/bluepy

a) Install pip3 (for python3, cos fk python2...)
For python3:
    `sudo apt update`
    `sudo apt install python3-pip`
    
//When the installation is complete, verify the installation by checking the pip version:
    `pip3 --version`
    
b) Install Dependencies for Bluepy
`sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev`
`sudo pip3 install bluepy`
// Check that bluepy is installed by typing in 'pip3 freeze' and scrolling up till you spot Bluepy with its version number

c) [Claire's side] Install Pycryptodome for Encrypted communications for external comms
`sudo pip3 install pycryptodome`

*It is important that you do not install any other crypto libraries that are not already pre-installed, else build might break...

d) [Jiannan's side] Install pandas and scipy for ML preprocessing
`sudo pip3 install pandas`
`sudo pip3 install scipy`

###
Now all the necessary libraries should be installed, py program ready to be run on laptop!

a) Clone the fitNests github repo
`git clone https://github.com/fitNests/fitNests.git`

b) Look at README.txt for more info
